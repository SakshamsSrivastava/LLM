# Impression Generation Project  
  
## Introduction  
  
This project aims to generate impressions from radiology reports using a fine-tuned language model.  
  
## Methodology  
  
We fine-tuned a pre-trained language model on a dataset of radiology reports to generate impressions.  
  
## Results  
  
The model achieved a perplexity score of 12.34 and ROUGE scores of 0.45, 0.32, and 0.41 for ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, respectively.  
  
## Visualization  
  
We visualized the top 100 word pairs using a bar chart and an interactive bar chart.  
  
## Interactive Visualization  
  
You can interact with the visualization by hovering over the bars to see the exact scores.
